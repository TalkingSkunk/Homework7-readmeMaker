## Description

### What needs are we meeting?
* You are a busy coder, and you need a fast generator of README.md, so that you can spend more time in coding.


### What would be the foreseeable consequences if the needs are unmet?
* You will not be able to save time, which could be spent on coding, or reading a good book.


### What were your goals?
* Create a logical Table of Contents.
* Ask for user inputs.
* Create the chosen license.
* Create the chosen badge(s).
* Create a standing template for markdown file.
* Notify user of completion.


### What have you done about it?
* All goals are met.



## Installation

* You need to install nodejs to your local computer.
* You need to create package.json and node_modules by entering:
    1. ``` npm init -y ```
    2. ``` npm install inquirer ```
* Run ``` node index.js ``` on your command line, and follow the prompts.



## Features

* Given you have started ``` node index.js ``` on your command line,
    * When you do not enter any inputs,
        - Then prompt will give an error message, and refuse to continue.
    * When you finish the prompts,
        - Then the application will create a new README.md file with your inputs.
